            <h4>Kimchi</h4>
            <div>

                <div>
                    <p>Kimchi is a traditional Korean dish whose components can vary but usually include some
                        combination of vegetables, garlic, ginger, chili peppers, salt, and fish sauce. The mix is
                        pickled and fermented, which was originally a way to preserve the vegetables for the winter
                        months. Cabbage is the most common vegetable used to make kimchi although carrots, radish,
                        cucumber, and scallions are also frequently used, too. There are hundreds of kimchi recipes that
                        vary depending on the region and season in which they are produced, and it's very easy to make
                        it a vegan dish by keeping all the ingredients plant-based.</p>

                    <p>Kimchi is available commercially and isn't expensive, but it can be fun to put together your own
                        based on preferences. It can take a little bit of time to prepare the vegetables, but like other
                        fermented foods (e.g., bread, beer, and kombucha), it's mostly a hands-off experience. It will
                        develop its flavors and its nutritional profile during that process. Kimchi keeps for a while,
                        making it an economical, versatile, and easy-to-prepare food item to have in the fridge.</p>

            <h4>Bibimbap</h4>
            <div>
                <img src="../images/20230113-Bibimbap-AmandaSuarez-hero-331e5e1ffa5b400fbb684e59b14d57c1.jpeg"
                    alt="Bibimbap">
                <div>
                    <p>It's called <em>bibimbap</em> (pronounced <q>bee-BIM-bop</q>)—<em>bibim</em> meaning <q>mixed</q>
                        and <em>bap</em> meaning <q>rice.</q>
                        This beloved Korean bowl incorporates steamed white rice with assorted fresh, marinated, and
                        sautéed vegetables along with raw or seared meat, if desired. It is always served with an egg,
                        most often served sunny-side-up, as well as strips of crunchy and light seasoned seaweed. Kimchi
                        or other fermented veggies, as well as pickled ingredients, lend added depth while the
                        gochujang—Korea's iconic fermented red chili pepper paste—imbues the bowls with a smoky, savory,
                        slightly sweet, slightly spicy flavor profile. The tastes and textures are crunchy and luscious,
                        spicy and sweet with pickled and fermented notes.</p>

                    <p>When you see the most gorgeous finished product, you might think bibimbap is too complicated for
                        you, but you'd be wrong. It's been around for centuries and ancient lore has it straddling the
                        highest and lowest echelons of society: Some say it was served to emperors and government
                        officials at lavish parties, while others say that it was a cheap and convenient one-bowl meal
                        that farmers' wives made using seasonal ingredients mixed with rice. Either way, these legends
                        still ring true as bibimbap can be as complicated or as simple as you want it to be.

            <h4>Japchae</h4>
            <div>
                <img src="../images/japchae_plate.jpg" alt="Japchae">
                <div>
                    <p>Japchae (잡채 - or <em>chapchae</em>) is a classic Korean stir-fried noodle dish seasoned with a sweet and
                        savory sauce. The name <em>japchae</em> describes a mix of finely cut ingredients—vegetables, egg,
                        mushroom, and meat—that are included in the noodles.
                    </p>

                    <p>According to Seonkyoung, Korean cuisine shares the same philosophy as Japanese cuisine where the
                        balancing of colors and seasonality are taken into consideration. The juxtaposition of flavors
                        and textures and the vibrant colors are all part of the appeal of a recipe like japchae.
                    </p>

                    <p>As one of Korea's most-loved dishes, not only can you find japchae being served at small parties,
                        fancy banquets, and special occasions like New Year's day, but it is also a staple dish enjoyed
                        any day of the week. In Korea, people enjoy japchae hot, warm, or even at room temperature,
                        because it is delicious regardless of how you serve it.
